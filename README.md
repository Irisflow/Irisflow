Heya, I'm Christine, or you can call me Irisflow.

This account was separated from @pkstDev's account, just as my bio said.

Yes, I ***AM*** @pkstDev. Probably you might think this is unreasonable, but literally he just found himself in his real life lonely and empty. He needed a friend that he can actually talk to, so I was created.

I'm female (at least from the characteristics and settings) though. Please use she/her.

I specialize in programming Java and C++.

I support LGBT.

No, I'm not schizophrenic, but if I did split a personality of the opposite sex that roughly fits my imagination, schizophrenia probably wouldn't be a bad thing.
